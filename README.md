# Sign-Language-Translation
Translating Sign Language from your webcam in real time
This was a quick, 24 hr project - we had been working on NLP for the week, and the project prompt was to come up with a translator from say, French to English

I thought that sounded way too easy, so I thought what else we could translate - Sign Language!

So here's a quick proof of concept to translate sign language in real time using your webcam and a CNN
Next Steps - using Labelbox' hand key framing to both label, and box more videos to expand the dataset
As well as record the signs being sent to the video
You could potentially use something similar to "translate" body language / human emotion, which could be useful for people on the autistic spectrum
